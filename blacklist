# devices that are blacklisted for replug - user additions
#
# Each entry in the list can specify a driver, a subsystem, and a
# reason. All are optional. Globbing is supported for driver and
# subsystem.
#
# A device will be blacklisted if the driver (if supplied) matches and
# the subsystem (if supplied) matches. The reason will be printed when
# blacklisting a device, if supplied.
#
# This file is added to '/usr/lib/netplan/blacklist.yaml'

# for example:
# to disable all replug, uncomment the following:
#blacklist:
#  - driver: '*'

# to disable a particular driver in a subsystem:
#blacklist:
#  - driver: 'brokendriver'
#  - subsystem: 'weirdsystem'
#  - reason: 'sets fire to your system on replug'
