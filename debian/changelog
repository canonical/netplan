      rebind. (LP: #1712224)
  * Autopkgtests:
    - Add allow-stderr. Systemd now bleats about a the networkd socket still
      being around and enabled when we restart the service; but we don't need
      to care since we're /restarting/ the service to load the new config.
    - Fix the autostart package to be more sensible: we don't really care if
      networkd autostarts or not, but we need to make sure that our generator
      will run at boot, so instead check the state, but only assert it once
      we've added a config file and before checking the state of our dummy
      device.
    - Do a bit more to make sure "mix" tests which stack virtual devices are
      as reliable as possible; by setting saner defaults.

  * tests/integration.py: clean up after br0 in networkd's test_bridge_mac; as
    the remaining interface and udev configuration can confuse NetworkManager
    now that it seems to manage random devices it did not create again.
    (LP: #1699371)
  * src/nm.c: set the MTU even though we also specify it in systemd-networkd
    for consumption by udev. NetworkManager will try to set it and might
    otherwise default to the wrong value.
  * src/networkd.c: Set IPv6AcceptRA=no anytime we don't do DHCPv6 (or by the
    same config, SLAAC), and don't have static addresses set. This should fix
    the cases where unconfigured devices still get an IPv6 address.
    (LP: #1655440)
  * src/nm.c: Explicitly set IPv6 method=ignore when IPv6 is otherwise not
    configured; this follows the same logic as setting IPv6AcceptRA=no in
    networkd, with the exception that NM does not currently disable RAs. When
    it does, an unconfigured device for IPv6 will truly be left with no config.

  * tests/cli.py: Test "generate" more precisely
  * Let "make coverage" fail if coverage is < 100%
  * Support /run/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful if you want to try out a new network config before
    "committing" it to /etc: if your remote server is still reachable after
    "apply", you copy the files to /etc; otherwise rebooting will go back to
    the known-good state.
  * If global renderer is set to NM, allow NM to manage all devices.
    By default, NetworkManager only manages wifi and wwan devices (via
    /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf). If
    global renderer is set to NetworkManager, disable that file in /run so
    that NM will once again manage all devices. This should be configured on
    desktop systems.
  * netplan apply: Asynchronously restart networkd/NM.
    This avoids deadlocks when calling "apply" during the boot sequence.

  * networkd: Prefix generated files with "netplan-"
  * generate: Clean up obsolete generated configs (LP: #1608223)

  * netplan.5: Add missing NAME section
