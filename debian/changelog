    YAML. (LP: #1735317)
  * debian/postinst: Write breadcrumbs on disk in /etc/network/interfaces to
    denote the migration to using netplan. (LP: #1744968)
  * bridge: implement port-priority support for the NM and networkd backends.
    (LP: #1735821)
  * doc: routes are not top-level but per-interface. (LP: #1726695)
  * Rework CLI parsing / code layout to better handle subcommands.

  * src/nm.c: generate a UUID for a connection only as needed; when we're
    dealing with NM VLANs. (LP: #1712921)
  * debian/tests/autostart: Make the autostart test more verbose and avoid
    failing right from the start when systemd-networkd is disabled.
    (LP: #1699371)
  * tests/integration.py: bump the NetworkManager timeout for settling to
    120 seconds, autopkgtest infrastructure tends to be a little slow for the
    network device configuration to be applied and noticed by NM.

    broke default network config in LXD and was contrary to the defaults used
    by the kernel. Reopens LP: 1655440. (LP: #1717404)
  * Add "accept-ra:" key for all device types; this will default to OFF but
    allow users to disable processing Router Advertisements when required by
    their network setup. (LP: #1655440)

  * Bonding:
    - Add support for specifying a primary slave. (LP: #1709135)
  * Rebind:
    - Fix brcmfmac harder. Treat any 'brcmfmac' driver as not supporting
      rebind. (LP: #1712224)
  * Autopkgtests:
    - Add allow-stderr. Systemd now bleats about a the networkd socket still
      being around and enabled when we restart the service; but we don't need
      to care since we're /restarting/ the service to load the new config.
    - Fix the autostart package to be more sensible: we don't really care if
      networkd autostarts or not, but we need to make sure that our generator
      will run at boot, so instead check the state, but only assert it once
      we've added a config file and before checking the state of our dummy
      device.
    - Do a bit more to make sure "mix" tests which stack virtual devices are
      as reliable as possible; by setting saner defaults.

  * tests/generate.py: add a test to validate that correct blacklist entries
    are added when creating virtual devices.
  * tests/integration.py: clean up after br0 in networkd's test_bridge_mac; as
    the remaining interface and udev configuration can confuse NetworkManager
    now that it seems to manage random devices it did not create again.
    (LP: #1699371)
  * src/nm.c: set the MTU even though we also specify it in systemd-networkd
    for consumption by udev. NetworkManager will try to set it and might
    otherwise default to the wrong value.
  * src/networkd.c: Set IPv6AcceptRA=no anytime we don't do DHCPv6 (or by the
    same config, SLAAC), and don't have static addresses set. This should fix
    the cases where unconfigured devices still get an IPv6 address.
    (LP: #1655440)
  * src/nm.c: Explicitly set IPv6 method=ignore when IPv6 is otherwise not
    configured; this follows the same logic as setting IPv6AcceptRA=no in
    networkd, with the exception that NM does not currently disable RAs. When
    it does, an unconfigured device for IPv6 will truly be left with no config.

    It does not make sense to make "routes:" a global thing, they should be

nplan (0.11) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * Support /lib/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful for configuration snippets shipped by packages.
  * Add networkd support for wifi (LP: #1616928)
    networkd cannot handle wifi natively, so generate a wpa_supplicant
    configuration and unit that does the WLAN part and leave the IP part to
    networkd.
    This supports open and WPA2, and infrastructure and adhoc mode. "match:" is not
    supported as the netplan-wpa@.service helper unit is bound to the named network
    interface device unit.
  * As networkd can now handle wifi devices, use networkd consistently as a default
    renderer.
  * tests/integration.py: Kill leftover NetworkManager processes between tests.
    NetworkManager.service has KillMode=process and leaks dhclient processes.
  * Fix package description for updated yaml paths

  * Ship empty /etc/netplan in the package
  * NM: Explicitly disable implied DHCP default when DHCP is not enabled.

nplan (0.9) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * tests/integration.py: Improve debug messages on failure
  * netplan apply: disconnect devices from NetworkManager before restarting.
    Merely restarting NetworkManager does not suffice to apply a changed
    configuration, so disconnect managed devices first.
    Add autopkgtest to reproduce the problem and confirm the fix.
  * Fix configuration path in package description
  * networkd: Change generated config file prefix to "10-netplan"
    Just "netplan-*" sorts after /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link.
  * netplan apply: Force-replug network devices which are down to apply renames.
    Unbind/rebind network devices from their driver to simulate a hotplug, so
    that device renames get applied. Don't do this for devices which are up
    (or "unknown") though, to avoid disrupting existing network connections.
  * tests/integration.py: Add workaround for NM "unmanaged-devices="
    mishandling (LP #1615044)

nplan (0.8) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * tests/cli.py: Test "generate" more precisely
  * Let "make coverage" fail if coverage is < 100%
  * Support /run/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful if you want to try out a new network config before
    "committing" it to /etc: if your remote server is still reachable after
    "apply", you copy the files to /etc; otherwise rebooting will go back to
    the known-good state.
  * If global renderer is set to NM, allow NM to manage all devices.
    By default, NetworkManager only manages wifi and wwan devices (via
    /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf). If
    global renderer is set to NetworkManager, disable that file in /run so
    that NM will once again manage all devices. This should be configured on
    desktop systems.
  * netplan apply: Asynchronously restart networkd/NM.
    This avoids deadlocks when calling "apply" during the boot sequence.
