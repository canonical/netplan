# This script is a demo/example, making use of Netplan's CFFI Python bindings.
# It does process your local /etc/netplan/ hierarchy, so be careful using it.
# At first, it creates a Parser() object and a YAML patch, setting a
# "network.ethernets.eth99.dhcp4=true" value. It loads any existing Netplan
# YAML hierarcy from /etc/netplan/ and loads/applies the above mentioned patch
# on top of it. Afterwards, it creates a State() object, importing parsed data
# for validation and checks for any errors.
# On succesful validation, it walks through all NetDefs in the validated
# Netplan state and prints the Netplan ID and backend renderer of given NetDef.
# Finally, it writes the validated state (including the eth99.dhcp4 setting)
# back to disk in /etc/netplan/.
