**Netplan** is a network configuration abstraction renderer.

It is a **utility for network configuration** on a Linux system. You create a
description of the required interfaces and define what each should do.

Netplan meets the need of **easy, descriptive network configuration** in YAML
across a versatile set of server, desktop, cloud or IoT installations.

It is useful for **administrators of a Linux system** who want to use a common
network configuration, controlling different back ends like NetworkManager or
systemd-networkd.
