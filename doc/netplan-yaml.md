## Top-level configuration structure

The general structure of a Netplan YAML file is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  version: NUMBER
  renderer: STRING
  bonds: MAPPING
  bridges: MAPPING
  ethernets: MAPPING
  modems: MAPPING
  tunnels: MAPPING
  vlans: MAPPING
  vrfs: MAPPING
  wifis: MAPPING
  nm-devices: MAPPING
```

- **version** (number)

  > Defines what version of the configuration format is used. The only value supported is `2`. Defaults to `2` if not defined.

- **renderer** (scalar)

  > Defines what network configuration tool will be used to set up your configuration. Valid values are `networkd` and `NetworkManager`. Defaults to `networkd` if not defined.

- **bonds** (mapping)

  > Creates and configures link aggregation (bonding) devices.

- **bridges** (mapping)

  > Creates and configures bridge devices.

- **ethernets** (mapping)

  > Configures physical Ethernet interfaces.

- **modems** (mapping)

  > Configures modems

- **tunnels** (mapping)

  > Creates and configures different types of virtual tunnels.

- **vlans** (mapping)

  > Creates and configures VLANs.

- **vrfs** (mapping)

  > Configures Virtual Functions for SR-IOV devices.

- **wifis** (mapping)

  > Configures physical Wifi interfaces as client, adhoc or access point.

- **nm-devices** (mapping)

  > `nm-devices` are used in situations where Netplan doesn't support the connection type. The raw configuration expected by NetworkManager can be defined and will be passed as is (passthrough) to the `.nmconnection` file. Users will not normally use this type of device.

All the properties for all the device types will be described in the next sections.

## Properties for physical device types

These properties are used with physical devices such as Ethernet and Wifi network interfaces.

**Note:** Some options will not work reliably for devices matched by name only
and rendered by networkd, due to interactions with device renaming in udev.
Match devices by MAC when setting options like: `wakeonlan` or `*-offload`.

- **match** (mapping)

  > This selects a subset of available physical devices by various hardware
  > properties. The following configuration will then apply to all matching
  > devices, as soon as they appear. *All* specified properties must match.

  - **name** (scalar)

    > Current interface name. Globs are supported, and the primary use case for
    > matching on names, as selecting one fixed name can be more easily achieved
    > with having no `match:` at all and just using the ID (see above).
    > (`NetworkManager`: as of v1.14.0)

  - **macaddress** (scalar)

    > Device's 6-byte permanent MAC address in the form "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" or
    > 20 bytes for InfiniBand devices (IPoIB). Globs are not allowed.
    > This doesn't match virtual MAC addresses for veth, bridge, bond, vlan, ...

  - **driver** (scalar or sequence of scalars) – sequence since **0.104**

    > Kernel driver name, corresponding to the `DRIVER` udev property.
    > A sequence of globs is supported, any of which must match.
    > Matching on driver is *only* supported with networkd.

  Examples:

  - All cards on second PCI bus:
    ```yaml
    network:
      ethernets:
        myinterface:
          match:
            name: enp2*
    ```

  - Fixed MAC address:
    ```yaml
    network:
      ethernets:
        interface0:
          match:
            macaddress: 11:22:33:AA:BB:FF
    ```

  - First card of driver ``ixgbe``:
    ```yaml
    network:
      ethernets:
        nic0:
          match:
            driver: ixgbe
            name: en*s0
    ```

  - First card with a driver matching ``bcmgenet`` or ``smsc*``:
    ```yaml
    network:
      ethernets:
        nic0:
          match:
            driver: ["bcmgenet", "smsc*"]
            name: en*
    ```

- **set-name** (scalar)

  > When matching on unique properties such as path or MAC, or with additional
  > assumptions such as "there will only ever be one wifi device", match rules
  > can be written so that they only match one device. Then this property can be
  > used to give that device a more specific/desirable/nicer name than the
  > default from udev's ifnames. Any additional device that satisfies the match
  > rules will then fail to get renamed and keep the original kernel name (and
  > dmesg will show an error).

- **wakeonlan** (bool)

  > Enable wake on LAN. Off by default.

- **emit-lldp** (bool) – since **0.99**

  > (networkd backend only) Whether to emit LLDP packets. Off by default.

- **receive-checksum-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the hardware offload for
  > checksumming of ingress network packets is enabled (disabled). When unset,
  > the kernel's default will be used.

- **transmit-checksum-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the hardware offload for
  > checksumming of egress network packets is enabled (disabled). When unset,
  > the kernel's default will be used.

- **tcp-segmentation-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the TCP Segmentation
  > Offload (TSO) is enabled (disabled). When unset, the kernel's default will
  > be used.

- **tcp6-segmentation-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the TCP6 Segmentation
  > Offload (tx-tcp6-segmentation) is enabled (disabled). When unset, the
  > kernel's default will be used.

- **generic-segmentation-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the Generic Segmentation
  > Offload (GSO) is enabled (disabled). When unset, the kernel's default will
  > be used.

- **generic-receive-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the Generic Receive
  > Offload (GRO) is enabled (disabled). When unset, the kernel's default will
  > be used.

- **large-receive-offload** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) If set to true (false), the Large Receive Offload
  > (LRO) is enabled (disabled). When unset, the kernel's default will
  > be used.

- **openvswitch** (mapping) – since **0.100**

  > This provides additional configuration for the openvswitch network device.
  > If Open vSwitch is not available on the system, netplan treats the presence
  > of `openvswitch` configuration as an error.
  >
  > Any supported network device that is declared with the `openvswitch`
  > mapping (or any bond/bridge that includes an interface with an openvswitch
  > configuration) will be created in openvswitch instead of the defined
  > renderer. In the case of a `vlan` definition declared the same way,
  > netplan will create a fake VLAN bridge in openvswitch with the requested
  > `vlan` properties.

  - **external-ids** (mapping) – since **0.100**

    > Passed-through directly to Open vSwitch

  - **other-config** (mapping) – since **0.100**

    > Passed-through directly to Open vSwitch

  - **lacp** (scalar) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for bond interfaces. Accepts `active`, `passive` or `off` (the
    > default).

  - **fail-mode** (scalar) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for bridge interfaces. Accepts `secure` or `standalone` (the
    > default).

  - **mcast-snooping** (bool) – since **0.100**

  - **protocols** (sequence of scalars) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for bridge interfaces or the network section. List of protocols to
    > be used when negotiating a connection with the controller. Accepts
    > `OpenFlow10`, `OpenFlow11`, `OpenFlow12`, `OpenFlow13`, `OpenFlow14`,
    > and `OpenFlow15`.

  - **rstp** (bool) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for bridge interfaces. False by default.

  - **controller** (mapping) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for bridge interfaces. Specify an external OpenFlow controller.

    - **addresses** (sequence of scalars)

      > Set the list of addresses to use for the controller targets. The
      > syntax of these addresses is as defined in ovs-vsctl(8). Example:
      > addresses: `[tcp:127.0.0.1:6653, "ssl:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653"]`

    - **connection-mode** (scalar)

      > Set the connection mode for the controller. Supported options are
      > `in-band` and `out-of-band`. The default is `in-band`.

  - **ports** (sequence of sequence of scalars) – since **0.100**

    > Open vSwitch patch ports. Each port is declared as a pair of names
    > which can be referenced as interfaces in dependent virtual devices
    > (bonds, bridges).

    Example:
    ```yaml
    openvswitch:
      ports:
        - [patch0-1, patch1-0]
    ```

  - **ssl** (mapping) – since **0.100**

    > Valid for global `openvswitch` settings. Options for configuring SSL
    > server endpoint for the switch.

    - **ca-cert** (scalar)

      > Path to a file containing the CA certificate to be used.

    - **certificate** (scalar)

      > Path to a file containing the server certificate.

    - **private-key** (scalar)

      > Path to a file containing the private key for the server.

## Properties for all device types

- **renderer** (scalar)

  > Use the given networking backend for this definition. Currently supported
  > are `networkd` and `NetworkManager`. This property can be specified globally
  > in `network:`, for a device type (in e. g. `ethernets:`) or
  > for a particular device definition. Default is `networkd`.
  >
  > (Since 0.99) The `renderer` property has one additional acceptable value for
  > vlan objects (i. e. defined in `vlans:`): `sriov`. If a vlan is defined with
  > the `sriov` renderer for an SR-IOV Virtual Function interface, this causes
  > netplan to set up a hardware VLAN filter for it. There can be only one
  > defined per VF.

- **dhcp4** (bool)

  > Enable DHCP for IPv4. Off by default.

- **dhcp6** (bool)

  > Enable DHCP for IPv6. Off by default. This covers both stateless DHCP -
  > where the DHCP server supplies information like DNS nameservers but not the
  > IP address - and stateful DHCP, where the server provides both the address
  > and the other information.
  >
  > If you are in an IPv6-only environment with completely stateless
  > auto-configuration (SLAAC with RDNSS), this option can be set to cause the
  > interface to be brought up. (Setting accept-ra alone is not sufficient.)
  > Auto-configuration will still honor the contents of the router
  > advertisement and only use DHCP if requested in the RA.
  >
  > Note that **`rdnssd`**(8) is required to use RDNSS with networkd. No extra
  > software is required for NetworkManager.

- **ipv6-mtu** (scalar) – since **0.98**
  > Set the IPv6 MTU (only supported with `networkd` backend). Note
  > that needing to set this is an unusual requirement.
  >
  > **Requires feature: ipv6-mtu**

- **ipv6-privacy** (bool)

  > Enable IPv6 Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941) for the specified interface, and
  > prefer temporary addresses. Defaults to false - no privacy extensions. There
  > is currently no way to have a private address but prefer the public address.

- **link-local** (sequence of scalars)

  > Configure the link-local addresses to bring up. Valid options are 'ipv4'
  > and 'ipv6', which respectively allow enabling IPv4 and IPv6 link local
  > addressing. If this field is not defined, the default is to enable only
  > IPv6 link-local addresses. If the field is defined but configured as an
  > empty set, IPv6 link-local addresses are disabled as well as IPv4 link-
  > local addresses.
  >
  > This feature enables or disables link-local addresses for a protocol, but
  > the actual implementation differs per backend. On networkd, this directly
  > changes the behavior and may add an extra address on an interface. When
  > using the NetworkManager backend, enabling link-local has no effect if the
  > interface also has DHCP enabled.

  Examples:

  - Enable only IPv4 link-local: `link-local: [ ipv4 ]`
  - Enable all link-local addresses: `link-local: [ ipv4, ipv6 ]`
  - Disable all link-local addresses: `link-local: [ ]`

- **ignore-carrier** (bool) – since **0.104**

  > (networkd backend only) Allow the specified interface to be configured even
  > if it has no carrier.

- **critical** (bool)

  > Designate the connection as "critical to the system", meaning that special
  > care will be taken by to not release the assigned IP when the daemon is
  > restarted. (not recognized by NetworkManager)

- **dhcp-identifier** (scalar)

  > (networkd backend only) Sets the source of DHCPv4 client identifier. If
  > `mac` is specified, the MAC address of the link is used. If this option is
  > omitted, or if `duid` is specified, networkd will generate an
  > RFC4361-compliant client identifier for the interface by combining the
  > link's IAID and DUID.

- **dhcp4-overrides** (mapping)

  > (networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior; see the
  > `DHCP Overrides` section below.

- **dhcp6-overrides** (mapping)

  > (networkd backend only) Overrides default DHCP behavior; see the
  > `DHCP Overrides` section below.

- **accept-ra** (bool)

  > Accept Router Advertisement that would have the kernel configure IPv6 by
  > itself. When enabled, accept Router Advertisements. When disabled, do not
  > respond to Router Advertisements.  If unset use the host kernel default
  > setting.

- **addresses** (sequence of scalars and mappings)

  > Add static addresses to the interface in addition to the ones received
  > through DHCP or RA. Each sequence entry is in CIDR notation, i. e. of the
  > form `addr/prefixlen`. `addr` is an IPv4 or IPv6 address as recognized
  > by **`inet_pton`**(3) and `prefixlen` the number of bits of the subnet.
  >
  > For virtual devices (bridges, bonds, vlan) if there is no address
  > configured and DHCP is disabled, the interface may still be brought online,
  > but will not be addressable from the network.
  >
  > In addition to the addresses themselves one can specify configuration
  > parameters as mappings. Current supported options are:

  - **lifetime** (scalar) – since **0.100**

    > Default: ``forever``. This can be ``forever`` or ``0`` and corresponds
    > to the ``PreferredLifetime`` option in ``systemd-networkd``'s Address
    > section. Currently supported on the ``networkd`` backend only.

  - **label** (scalar) – since **0.100**

    > An IP address label, equivalent to the ``ip address label``
    > command. Currently supported on the ``networkd`` backend only.

  Examples:

  - Simple: ``addresses: [192.168.14.2/24, "2001:1::1/64"]``
  - Advanced:
    ```yaml
    network:
      ethernets:
        eth0:
          addresses:
            - "10.0.0.15/24":
                lifetime: 0
                label: "maas"
            - "2001:1::1/64"
    ```

- **ipv6-address-generation** (scalar) – since **0.99**

  > Configure method for creating the address for use with RFC4862 IPv6
  > Stateless Address Auto-configuration (only supported with `NetworkManager`
  > backend). Possible values are `eui64` or `stable-privacy`.

- **ipv6-address-token** (scalar) – since **0.100**

  > Define an IPv6 address token for creating a static interface identifier for
  > IPv6 Stateless Address Auto-configuration. This is mutually exclusive with
  > `ipv6-address-generation`.

- **gateway4**, **gateway6** (scalar)

  > Deprecated, see `Default routes`.
  > Set default gateway for IPv4/6, for manual address configuration. This
  > requires setting `addresses` too. Gateway IPs must be in a form
  > recognized by **`inet_pton`**(3). There should only be a single gateway
  > per IP address family set in your global config, to make it unambiguous.
  > If you need multiple default routes, please define them via
  > `routing-policy`.

  Examples

  - IPv4: `gateway4: 172.16.0.1`
  - IPv6: `gateway6: "2001:4::1"`

- **nameservers** (mapping)

  > Set DNS servers and search domains, for manual address configuration. There
  > are two supported fields: `addresses:` is a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
  > similar to `gateway*`, and `search:` is a list of search domains.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  network:
    ethernets:
      id0:
        [...]
        nameservers:
          search: [lab, home]
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, "FEDC::1"]
  ```

- **macaddress** (scalar)

  > Set the device's MAC address. The MAC address must be in the form
  > "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX".
  >
  > **Note:** This will not work reliably for devices matched by name
  > only and rendered by networkd, due to interactions with device
  > renaming in udev. Match devices by MAC when setting MAC addresses.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  network:
    ethernets:
      id0:
        match:
          macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:58
        [...]
        macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:59
  ```

- **mtu** (scalar)

  > Set the Maximum Transmission Unit for the interface. The default is 1500.
  > Valid values depend on your network interface.
  >
  > **Note:** This will not work reliably for devices matched by name
  > only and rendered by networkd, due to interactions with device
  > renaming in udev. Match devices by MAC when setting MTU.

- **optional** (bool)

  > An optional device is not required for booting. Normally, networkd will
  > wait some time for device to become configured before proceeding with
  > booting. However, if a device is marked as optional, networkd will not wait
  > for it. This is *only* supported by networkd, and the default is false.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  network:
    ethernets:
      eth7:
        # this is plugged into a test network that is often
        # down - don't wait for it to come up during boot.
        dhcp4: true
        optional: true
  ```

- **optional-addresses** (sequence of scalars)

  > Specify types of addresses that are not required for a device to be
  > considered online. This changes the behavior of backends at boot time to
  > avoid waiting for addresses that are marked optional, and thus consider
  > the interface as "usable" sooner. This does not disable these addresses,
  > which will be brought up anyway.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  network:
    ethernets:
      eth7:
        dhcp4: true
        dhcp6: true
        optional-addresses: [ ipv4-ll, dhcp6 ]
  ```

- **activation-mode** (scalar) – since **0.103**

  > Allows specifying the management policy of the selected interface. By
  > default, netplan brings up any configured interface if possible. Using the
  > `activation-mode` setting users can override that behavior by either
  > specifying `manual`, to hand over control over the interface state to the
  > administrator or (for networkd backend *only*) `off` to force the link
  > in a down state at all times. Any interface with `activation-mode`
  > defined is implicitly considered `optional`.
  > Supported officially as of `networkd` v248+.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  network:
    ethernets:
      eth1:
        # this interface will not be put into an UP state automatically
        dhcp4: true
        activation-mode: manual
  ```

- **routes** (sequence of mappings)

  > Configure static routing for the device; see the `Routing` section below.

- **routing-policy** (sequence of mappings)

  > Configure policy routing for the device; see the `Routing` section below.

- **neigh-suppress** (scalar) – since **0.105**

  > Takes a boolean. Configures whether ARP and ND neighbor suppression is
  > enabled for this port. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

## DHCP Overrides
Several DHCP behavior overrides are available. Most currently only have any
effect when using the `networkd` backend, with the exception of `use-routes`
and `route-metric`.

Overrides only have an effect if the corresponding `dhcp4` or `dhcp6` is
set to `true`.

If both `dhcp4` and `dhcp6` are `true`, the `networkd` backend requires
that `dhcp4-overrides` and `dhcp6-overrides` contain the same keys and
values. If the values do not match, an error will be shown and the network
configuration will not be applied.

When using the NetworkManager backend, different values may be specified for
`dhcp4-overrides` and `dhcp6-overrides`, and will be applied to the DHCP
client processes as specified in the netplan YAML.

- **dhcp4-overrides**, **dhcp6-overrides** (mapping)

  > The `dhcp4-overrides` and `dhcp6-override`` mappings override the
  > default DHCP behavior.

  - **use-dns** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the DNS servers received from the
    > DHCP server will be used and take precedence over any statically
    > configured ones. Currently only has an effect on the `networkd`
    > backend.

  - **use-ntp** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the NTP servers received from the
    > DHCP server will be used by systemd-timesyncd and take precedence
    > over any statically configured ones. Currently only has an effect on
    > the `networkd` backend.

  - **send-hostname** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the machine's hostname will be sent
    > to the DHCP server. Currently only has an effect on the `networkd`
    > backend.

  - **use-hostname** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the hostname received from the DHCP
     > server will be set as the transient hostname of the system. Currently
     > only has an effect on the `networkd` backend.

  - **use-mtu** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the MTU received from the DHCP
    > server will be set as the MTU of the network interface. When `false`,
    > the MTU advertised by the DHCP server will be ignored. Currently only
    > has an effect on the `networkd` backend.

  - **hostname** (scalar)

    > Use this value for the hostname which is sent to the DHCP server,
    > instead of machine's hostname. Currently only has an effect on the
    > `networkd` backend.

  - **use-routes** (bool)

    > Default: `true`. When `true`, the routes received from the DHCP
    > server will be installed in the routing table normally. When set to
    > `false`, routes from the DHCP server will be ignored: in this case,
    > the user is responsible for adding static routes if necessary for
    > correct network operation. This allows users to avoid installing a
    > default gateway for interfaces configured via DHCP. Available for
    > both the `networkd` and `NetworkManager` backends.

  - **route-metric** (scalar)

    > Use this value for default metric for automatically-added routes.
    > Use this to prioritize routes for devices by setting a lower metric
    > on a preferred interface. Available for both the `networkd` and
    > `NetworkManager` backends.

  - **use-domains** (scalar) – since **0.98**

    > Takes a boolean, or the special value "route". When true, the domain
    > name received from the DHCP server will be used as DNS search domain
    > over this link, similar to the effect of the Domains= setting. If set
    > to "route", the domain name received from the DHCP server will be
    > used for routing DNS queries only, but not for searching, similar to
    > the effect of the Domains= setting when the argument is prefixed with
    > "~".
    >
    > **Requires feature: dhcp-use-domains**


## Routing
Complex routing is possible with netplan. Standard static routes as well
as policy routing using routing tables are supported via the `networkd`
backend.

These options are available for all types of interfaces.

### Default routes

The most common need for routing concerns the definition of default routes to
reach the wider Internet. Those default routes can only defined once per IP
family and routing table. A typical example would look like the following:

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      [...]
      routes:
        - to: default # could be 0.0.0.0/0 optionally
          via: 10.0.0.1
          metric: 100
          on-link: true
        - to: default # could be ::/0 optionally
          via: cf02:de:ad:be:ef::2
    eth1:
      [...]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 172.134.67.1
          metric: 100
          on-link: true
          # Not on the main routing table,
          # does not conflict with the eth0 default route
      table: 76
```

- **routes** (mapping)

  > The `routes` block defines standard static routes for an interface.
  > At least `to` must be specified. If type is `local` or `nat` a
  > default scope of `host` is assumed.
  > If type is `unicast` and no gateway (`via`) is given or type is
  > `broadcast`, `multicast` or `anycast` a default scope of `link`
  > is assumed. Otherwise, a ``global`` scope is the default setting.
  >
  > For `from`, `to`, and `via`, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
  > recognized, and must be in the form `addr/prefixlen` or `addr`.

  - **from** (scalar)

    > Set a source IP address for traffic going through the route.
    > (`NetworkManager`: as of v1.8.0)

  - **to** (scalar)

    > Destination address for the route.

  - **via** (scalar)

## Authentication
Netplan supports advanced authentication settings for ethernet and wifi
interfaces, as well as individual wifi networks, by means of the `auth` block.

- **auth** (mapping)

  > Specifies authentication settings for a device of type `ethernets:`, or
  > an `access-points:` entry on a `wifis:` device.
  >
  > The `auth` block supports the following properties:

  - **key-management** (scalar)

    > The supported key management modes are `none` (no key management);
    > `psk` (WPA with pre-shared key, common for home wifi); `eap` (WPA
    > with EAP, common for enterprise wifi); and `802.1x` (used primarily
    > for wired Ethernet connections).

  - **password** (scalar)

    > The password string for EAP, or the pre-shared key for WPA-PSK.

    The following properties can be used if `key-management` is `eap`
    or `802.1x`:

  - **method** (scalar)

     > The EAP method to use. The supported EAP methods are `tls` (TLS),
    > `peap` (Protected EAP), and `ttls` (Tunneled TLS).

## Properties for device type `ethernets:`

The general structure for Ethernet devices is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    device-id:
      ...
```

`device-id` is the interface identifier. If you use the interface name as the ID, Netplan will match that interface.

Consider the example below. In this case, an interface called `eth0` will be configured with DHCP.

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: true
```

The `device-id` can be any descriptive name your find meaningful. Although, if it doesn't match a real interface name, you must use the property `match` to identify the device you want to configure.

The example below defines an Ethernet connection called `isp-interface` (supposedly an external interface connected to the Internet Service Provider) and uses `match` to apply the configuration to the physical device with MAC address `aa:bb:cc:00:11:22`.

```yaml
network:
  ethernets:
    isp-interface:
      match:
        macaddress: aa:bb:cc:00:11:22
      dhcp4: true
```


Ethernet device definitions, beyond common ones described above, also support
some additional properties that can be used for SR-IOV devices.

- **link** (scalar) – since **0.99**

  > (SR-IOV devices only) The `link` property declares the device as a
  > Virtual Function of the selected Physical Function device, as identified
  > by the given netplan id.

      enp1s16f1:
        link: enp1
  ```

- **virtual-function-count** (scalar) – since **0.99**

  > (SR-IOV devices only) In certain special cases VFs might need to be
  > configured outside of netplan. For such configurations
  > `virtual-function-count` can be optionally used to set an explicit number of
  > Virtual Functions for the given Physical Function. If unset, the default is
  > to create only as many VFs as are defined in the netplan configuration. This
  > should be used for special cases only.

  > Can be enabled when bonding/VF LAG is in use. Defaults to `false`.
  >
  > **Requires feature: eswitch-mode**

- **infiniband-mode** (scalar) – since **0.105**

  > (InfiniBand devices only) Change the operational mode of a IPoIB device.
  > Possible values are `datagram` or `connected`. If unspecified the
  > kernel's default configuration is used.
  >
  > **Requires feature: infiniband**

## Properties for device type `modems:`
GSM/CDMA modem configuration is only supported for the `NetworkManager`
backend. `systemd-networkd` does not support modems.

  > any device also allowed by `device-id` which contains a SIM card matching
  > the given identifier.

- **sim-operator-id** (scalar) – since **0.99**

  > Specify the MCC/MNC string (such as "310260" or "21601") which identifies
  > the carrier that this connection should apply to. If given, the connection
  > will apply to any device also allowed by `device-id` and `sim-id`
  > which contains a SIM card provisioned by the given operator.

- **username** (scalar) – since **0.99**

  > Specify the username used to authenticate with the carrier network. This
  > can be omitted if `auto-config` is enabled.

## Properties for device type `wifis:`

The general YAML structure for Wifi devices is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  wifis:
    wlp0s1:
      access-points:
        "network_ssid_name":
          password: "**********"
```

Note that `systemd-networkd` does not natively support wifi, so you need
wpasupplicant installed if you let the `networkd` renderer handle wifi.

- **access-points** (mapping)

  > This provides pre-configured connections to NetworkManager. Note that
  > users can of course select other access points/SSIDs. The keys of the
  > mapping are the SSIDs, and the values are mappings with the following
  > supported properties:

  - **password** (scalar)

    > Enable WPA/WPA2 authentication and set the passphrase for it. If neither
    > this nor an `auth` block are given, the network is assumed to be
    > open. The setting
    > ```yaml
    > password: "S3kr1t"
    > ```
    > is equivalent to
    > ```yaml
    > auth:
    >   key-management: psk
    >   password: "S3kr1t"
    > ```

  - **mode** (scalar)

    > Possible access point modes are `infrastructure` (the default),
    > `ap` (create an access point to which other devices can connect),
    > and `adhoc` (peer to peer networks without a central access point).
    > `ap` is only supported with NetworkManager.

  - **bssid** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > If specified, directs the device to only associate with the given
    > access point.

  - **band** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Possible bands are `5GHz` (for 5GHz 802.11a) and `2.4GHz`
    > (for 2.4GHz 802.11), do not restrict the 802.11 frequency band of the
    > network if unset (the default).

  - **channel** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Wireless channel to use for the Wi-Fi connection. Because channel
    > numbers overlap between bands, this property takes effect only if
    > the `band` property is also set.

  - **hidden** (bool) – since **0.100**

    > Set to `true` to change the SSID scan technique for connecting to
    > hidden WiFi networks. Note this may have slower performance compared
    > to `false` (the default) when connecting to publicly broadcast
    > SSIDs.

- **wakeonwlan** (sequence of scalars) – since **0.99**

  > This enables WakeOnWLan on supported devices. Not all drivers support all
  > options. May be any combination of `any`, `disconnect`, `magic_pkt`,
  > `gtk_rekey_failure`, `eap_identity_req`, `four_way_handshake`,
  > `rfkill_release` or `tcp` (NetworkManager only). Or the exclusive
  > `default` flag (the default).

- **regulatory-domain** (scalar) – since **0.105**

  > This can be used to define the radio's regulatory domain, to make use of
  > additional WiFi channels outside the "world domain". Takes an ISO /
  > IEC 3166 country code (like `GB`) or `00` to reset to the "world domain".

  > for available values.
  >
  > **Requires dependency: iw**, if it is to be used outside the `networkd`
  > (wpa_supplicant) backend.

## Properties for device type `bridges:`

The general structure for bridges is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  bridges:
    br0:
      ...
```

When applied, a virtual interface of type bridge called `br0` will be created in the system.

The specific settings for bridges are defined below.

  > milliseconds) to allow for more control over its behavior.

  - **ageing-time**, **aging-time** (scalar)

    > Set the period of time to keep a MAC address in the forwarding
    > database after a packet is received. This maps to the AgeingTimeSec=
    > property when the networkd renderer is used. If no time suffix is
    > specified, the value will be interpreted as seconds.

  - **priority** (scalar)

    > Set the priority value for the bridge. This value should be a

    > priority. The bridge with the higher priority will be elected as
    > the root bridge.

  - **port-priority** (scalar)

    > Set the port priority to <priority>. The priority value is
    > a number between `0` and `63`. This metric is used in the
    > designated port and root port selection algorithms.

  - **forward-delay** (scalar)

    > Specify the period of time the bridge will remain in Listening and
    > Learning states before getting to the Forwarding state. This field

    > seconds.

  - **hello-time** (scalar)

    > Specify the interval between two hello packets being sent out from

    > is specified, the value will be interpreted as seconds.

  - **max-age** (scalar)

    > Set the maximum age of a hello packet. If the last hello packet is
    > older than that value, the bridge will attempt to become the root
    > bridge. This maps to the MaxAgeSec= property when the networkd
    > renderer is used. If no time suffix is specified, the value will be
    > interpreted as seconds.

  - **path-cost** (scalar)

    > Set the cost of a path on the bridge. Faster interfaces should have
    > a lower cost. This allows a finer control on the network topology
    > so that the fastest paths are available whenever possible.

  - **stp** (bool)

    > Define whether the bridge should use Spanning Tree Protocol. The
    > default value is "true", which means that Spanning Tree should be
    > used.


## Properties for device type `bonds:`

The general configuration structure for bonds is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  bonds:
    bond0:
      ...
```

When applied, a virtual interface of type bond called `bond0` will be created in the system.

The specific settings for bonds are defined below.

  - **mii-monitor-interval** (scalar)

    > Specifies the interval for MII monitoring (verifying if an interface
    > of the bond has carrier). The default is `0`; which disables MII
    > monitoring. This is equivalent to the MIIMonitorSec= field for the
    > networkd backend. If no time suffix is specified, the value will be
    > interpreted as milliseconds.

  - **min-links** (scalar)

    > The minimum number of links up in a bond to consider the bond
    > interface to be up.

    > behavior in most situations.
    >
    > Alias: **all-slaves-active**  <!--- wokeignore:rule=slave -->

  - **arp-interval** (scalar)

    > Set the interval value for how frequently ARP link monitoring should

    > milliseconds.

  - **arp-ip-targets** (sequence of scalars)

    > IPs of other hosts on the link which should be sent ARP requests in
    > order to validate that a port is up. This option is only used when
    > `arp-interval` is set to a value other than `0`. At least one IP
    > address must be given for ARP link monitoring to function. Only IPv4
    > addresses are supported. You can specify up to 16 IP addresses. The

    > enabled. Possible values are `any` and `all`.

  - **up-delay** (scalar)

    > Specify the delay before enabling a link once the link is physically
    > up. The default value is `0`. This maps to the UpDelaySec= property

    > link monitor. If no time suffix is specified, the value will be
    > interpreted as milliseconds.

  - **down-delay** (scalar)

    > Specify the delay before disabling a link once the link has been
    > lost. The default value is `0`. This maps to the DownDelaySec=
    > property for the networkd renderer. This option is only valid for the

    > be interpreted as milliseconds.

  - **fail-over-mac-policy** (scalar)

    > Set whether to set all ports to the same MAC address when adding
    > them to the bond, or how else the system should handle MAC addresses.
    > The possible values are `none`, `active`, and `follow`.

  - **gratuitous-arp** (scalar)

    > Specify how many ARP packets to send after failover. Once a link is
    > up on a new port, a notification is sent and possibly repeated if
    > this value is set to a number greater than `1`. The default value
    > is `1` and valid values are between `1` and `255`. This only
    > affects `active-backup` mode.
    >
    > For historical reasons, the misspelling `gratuitious-arp` is also
    > accepted and has the same function.

  - **packets-per-member** (scalar) – since **0.106**

    > In `balance-rr` mode, specifies the number of packets to transmit
    > on a port before switching to the next. When this value is set to
    > `0`, ports are chosen at random. Allowable values are between
    > `0` and `65535`. The default value is `1`. This setting is
    > only used in `balance-rr` mode.
    >
    > Alias: **packets-per-slave** <!--- wokeignore:rule=slave -->

  - **primary-reselect-policy** (scalar)

    > Set the reselection policy for the primary port. On failure of the

  - **resend-igmp** (scalar)

    > In modes `balance-rr`, `active-backup`, `balance-tlb` and

    > are sent at 200ms intervals.

  - **learn-packet-interval** (scalar)

    > Specify the interval between sending learning packets to
    > each port.  The value range is between `1` and `0x7fffffff`.
    > The default value is `1`. This option only affects `balance-tlb`
    > and `balance-alb` modes. Using the networkd renderer, this field
    > maps to the LearnPacketIntervalSec= property. If no time suffix is
    > specified, the value will be interpreted as seconds.

  - **primary** (scalar)

    > Specify a device to be used as a primary port, or preferred device
    > to use as a port for the bond (i.e. the preferred device to send
    > data through), whenever it is available. This only affects

## Properties for device type `tunnels:`

The general configuration structure for tunnels is shown below.

```yaml
network:
  tunnels:
    tunnel0:
      mode: SCALAR
      ...
```

When applied, a virtual interface called `tunnel0` will be created in the system. Its operation mode is defined by the property `mode`.

Tunnels allow traffic to pass as if it was between systems on the same local
network, although systems may be far from each other but reachable via the
Internet. They may be used to support IPv6 traffic on a network where the ISP
does not provide the service, or to extend and "connect" separate local
networks. Please see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol> for
more general information about tunnels.

The specific settings for tunnels are defined below.


- **mode** (scalar)

  > Defines the tunnel mode. Valid options are `sit`, `gre`, `ip6gre`,
  > `ipip`, `ipip6`, `ip6ip6`, `vti`, `vti6`, `wireguard` and `vxlan`.
  > Additionally, the `networkd` backend also supports `gretap` and
  > `ip6gretap` modes.
  > In addition, the `NetworkManager` backend supports `isatap` tunnels.

- **local** (scalar)

  > Defines the address of the local endpoint of the tunnel. (For VXLAN) This
  > should match one of the parent's IP addresses or make use of the networkd
  > special values.


- **remote** (scalar)

  > Defines the address of the remote endpoint of the tunnel or multicast group
  > IP address for VXLAN.

- **ttl** (scalar) – since **0.103**

  > Defines the Time To Live (TTL) of the tunnel.

- **key**  (scalar or mapping)

  > Define keys to use for the tunnel. The key can be a number or a dotted
  > quad (an IPv4 address). For `wireguard` it can be a base64-encoded
  > private key or (as of `networkd` v242+) an absolute path to a file,
  > containing the private key (since 0.100).
  > It is used for identification of IP transforms. This is only required
  > for `vti` and `vti6` when using the networkd backend.
  >
  > This field may be used as a scalar (meaning that a single key is
  > specified and to be used for input, output and private key), or as a
  > mapping, where you can further specify `input`/`output`/`private`.

## Properties for device type `nm-devices:`

The `nm-devices` device type is for internal use only and should not be used in
normal configuration files. It enables a fallback mode for unsupported settings,
using the `passthrough` mapping.


## Backend-specific configuration parameters

In addition to the other fields available to configure interfaces, some
backends may require to record some of their own parameters in netplan,
especially if the netplan definitions are generated automatically by the
consumer of that backend. Currently, this is only used with `NetworkManager`.

- **networkmanager** (mapping) – since **0.99**

  > Keeps the NetworkManager-specific configuration parameters used by the
  > daemon to recognize connections.

  - **name** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Set the display name for the connection.

  - **uuid** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Defines the UUID (unique identifier) for this connection, as
    > generated by NetworkManager itself.

  - **stable-id** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Defines the stable ID (a different form of a connection name) used
    > by NetworkManager in case the name of the connection might otherwise
    > change, such as when sharing connections between users.

  - **device** (scalar) – since **0.99**

    > Defines the interface name for which this connection applies.

  - **passthrough** (mapping) – since **0.102**

    > Can be used as a fallback mechanism to missing keyfile settings.
