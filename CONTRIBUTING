# Contributing to netplan.io

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to netplan!

Here are the guidelines for contributing to the development of netplan. These
are guidelines, not hard and fast rules; but please exercise judgement. Feel
free to propose changes to this document.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to
[netplan-developers@lists.launchpad.net](mailto:netplan-developers@lists.launchpad.net).

## What should I know before I get started?

### Did you find a bug?

If you've found a bug, please make sure to report it on Launchpad against the
[netplan](http://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan) project. We do use these bug reports
to make it easier to backport features to supported releases of Ubuntu: having
an existing bug report, with people who understand well how the bug appears
helps immensely in making sure the feature or bug fix is well tested when it is
being released to supported Ubuntu releases.

### Code quality

We want to maintain the quality of the code in netplan to the highest possible
degree. As such, we do insist on keeping a code coverage with unit tests to 100%
coverage if it is possible. If not, please make sure to explain why when submitting
a pull request, and expect reviewers to challenge you on that decision and suggest
a course of action.

### Conventions

The netplan project mixes C and python code. Generator code is generally all
written in C, while the UI / command-line interface is written in python. Please
look at the surrounding code, and make a best effort to follow the general style
used in the code. We do insist on proper indentation (4 spaces), but we will
not block good features and bug fixes on purely style issues. Please exercise
your best judgement: if it looks odd or too clever to you, chances are it will
look odd or too clever to code reviewers. In that case, you may be asked for
some styles changes in a pull request. Similary, if you see code that you
find hard to understand, we do encourage that you submit pull requests that
help make the code easier to understand and maintain.
